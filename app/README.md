Built a User interface for a fraud detection system that uses transaction details to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. Users must input several pieces of information related to a financial transaction: the step number (possibly a time indicator), the transaction amount, the old and new balances of both the origin and destination accounts. Finally, thereâ€™s a field to enter whether the transaction is flagged as fraud. Once all the data is entered, the user can click on "Predict Transaction" to evaluate the likelihood of fraud.
